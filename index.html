	<p> some of you may be aware of the interesting developments coming (<em>*ghost voice* pdpqqqqqq....</em>). be not alarmed; they shall be along... some day or another here. in the meantime, though,
	i'm going on a whole adventure that has taken me from the exton mall to w3schools to a plane thousands of miles above texas. the plane part was probably the most interesting segment... suddenly overcome
	 by the base urge to conquer javascript, five minutes before the plane was set to board, i whipped out my laptop and started googling frantically. that information and the few screenshots i managed to grab 
	served me decently well... that is, to a point. several hours in to the flight itself, i wound up staring at my device, out of experience, trying desperately to guess at any potential parallels between the
	 syntax of java and javascript. (i found out a bit too late after that that the equivalent to a hashmap is just called a "map" in js... would have liked to know that a lot sooner...) the progress was slow-- 
	but steady-- but slow.</p>
	<p>flash forward to me not having touched it in weeks.</p>
	<p>c'est la vie, i suppose. being catapulted straight from build season to exam season was bound to present a damper. the long-anticipated mysterious work (<em>*ghost voice* pdpqqqqqq....!</em>) will 
	turn out sooner than later. it's just a matter of when i catch a second between finals to iron out the transitions...</p>
