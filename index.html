	<p>there are two sides to being a bugeisha (practitioner of the traditional japanese martial arts) in the modern day, especially if one practices the way of the sword (iaido/kenjutsu).</p>
	<p>one is the front-facing aspect. an after-school activity, maybe a resume item. a quirk that friends remember- an ice-breaker. a personality trait. "being good at sword" is an odd thing, an 
	artifact of action media, then of some vague past, then of the individual. it fades into the background. (this, not even taking into account those who become suspicious or fearful at the 
	mention of such a skill.)</p>
	<p>the other runs far deeper. for the practitioner, the "way of the sword" has infinite depth beyond the sword itself. such unity permiates the physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects 
	of the craft that it proves a bit challenging to decide upon a jumping-off point for explanation. that in itself is a point of concept-- the illusion of separation, everything as somewhere in the 
	space between linked and unified, lends itself to imagery of oneness or circuity that continues to recur. ...the practice itself deters those unmotivated to learn by its nature.</p>
	<p>once in a while, my sensei invokes the phrase "you don't need a sword to practice sword." in context, the phrase references technique; one need not have a weapon in hand to practice the motions 
	and concentration of iai. as consideration of the thought continues, it begins to extend far beyond the surface-level implication of moving through forms empty-handed. one need not have a sword on 
	hand to practice footwork day to day, either-- i frequently notice myself walking around school, on the street, and at home with the sliding steps of the practitioner, knees in line with my feet and 
	heels close to the ground in a way of stepping altogether uncommon in the west. even further, one need not be in motion to practice the frame of mind of the swordsman-- an individual trained in the 
	way will keep ambient awareness (<em>zanshin</em>) and a clear mind (<em>mushin</em>, or, well, an oversimplification thereof) even at rest.</p>
	<p>as a sort of middle ground, i've found that, between my own research and input from my seniors at the dojo, i've picked up several of the day-to-day habits of the warriors of old. while eating, 
	especially in a context where i might pair whatever food i might have come upon with chopsticks, i tend not only to pick up the dish with my opposite hand as is commonly culturally advised along with 
	such food, but to partake in the bushi (alternate word for samurai basically) -specific mannerism of hooking a thumb over the dish's rim. (this was intended to prevent a potential attacker from 
	being able to splash the food up into one's face. as with most of these habits, this action is considered a way to maintain zanshin.) in moments of either stress of meditation, i find myself resorting 
	to a breathing technique utilized by the yagyu shinkage ryu school of swordsmanship (adjacent to my own) to center myself. (something of a centuries-old, slightly more intense iteration of box 
	breathing, i first attempted the method in the context of sword practice and the habit seemed to stick. if anyone's curious, the sequence is: breath in over a count of ten, hold for a count of five, 
	breath out for a count of ten, hold for a count of five, repeat. the goal is to become able to count more and more slowly.) people have even told me they've noticed me bowing to them as i speak (a 
	traditional means of puctuating communication with courtesy, used as such in training). despite the fact that the title of "samurai" (at its core, referring to a class among old Japan's social order) 
	has been obsolete for nearly two centuries, i have apparently been taken by my practice of the martial arts to the point where i exhibit something from those who used it as granular as body language.</p>
	<p>and it really has changed my life. i won't harp on the matter too long, but i feel in every way indebted to my experience with martial arts to the successes i have been able to find and the way 
	i now conduct myself. this, as with most of the thoughts presented, is abbrevated to what feels like a nearly futile point.</p>
	<p>as one might imagine, it gets to the point where, in some capacity, you feel like a samurai. not to lay any cultural claims or invoke any media images; in the sense that you feel like a participant, 
	relate to the associated codex of behavior with consistency and intensity. there is a bond running between yourself and the past, a sense of kinship between you and a group of people that existed 
	on the opposite side of the world some span of centuries too early. but the samurai no longer exist; the title may not be further delegated; to be among their ranks would have been to live and die 
	decades on decades before you were born. in this way, every stroke of the sword carries a dash of odd somberness.</p>
	<p>i would like to note that there is a massive privilege in this distance. i speak as though i would fit right in with the bushi were i to travel back in time, though several aspects of my identity 
	would generally preclude this. <em>onna-musha</em>, female practitioners, did exist, but were not only extremely rare but generally disrespected by samurai society as per the misogynistic nature of confucianism. 
	there are recorded instances of foreigners becoming samurai, though i can count the number of examples i gather from the periphery of my memory on one hand. in the modern day, though naturally diffusing 
	themselves in the process, traditional martial arts practices have spread across locations and demographics in a major way key to my partcipation.</p>
	<p>during one of the few katana zero playthroughs i've sat through among friends, i recall encountering a dialogue option that particularly spoke to me. not, as some may be guessing, the moment where we 
	noticed that zero practices, in effect, the same school as i do-- rather, a quiet moment between the main character and the lone-wolf-and-cub child he's taken under his wing. while the two are watching what appears 
	to be (what i at least choose to believe is) an akira kurosawa film, the girl asks the swordsman if he, like the warriors on the screen, is a samurai. i hope it's clear now why i choked up just a touch as, 
	gazing across my laptop's screen at this sprite, decked out in bushi regalia, doing his best to reach out to the culture of the art he practices through the dense urban jungle-- the future-- surrounding 
	him, i insisted that we choose the latter response out of <em>yes</em>, <em>no</em>, and <em>i don't know</em>.</p>

<p>the title says it all basically</p>
<p>some of y'all are aware of the fact that there was a period in my life where i was so into star wars that i learned how to speak the conlang they wrote for mandalorians... in honor of may the fourth, here's some 
tidbits about the language and some facts! initially, a little more about my own experience.</p>
<p>there's two main dictionaries out and about: the old one (<a href="https://mandoa.org" target="blank">mandoa.org</a>) and the new one with all the cool features (<a href="https://mandocreator.com" target="blank">used to just be a site for cosplayers to conceptualize 
the armor they were building</a>). when i first became interested, only the first existed-- i pretty quickly became quite an active user of the forum it linked out to. </br>
<img src="joha.png" alt="me yapping with my internet friend about fireworks on the fourth of july" width="300">
</br>if you're still wondering what a middle school zoe could have 
possibly gotten up to on the mando'a side of the internet, here's <a href="http://forum.mandoa.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=237" target="blank">a thread i started in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>mando'a was written in the 2000s-ish for the most part by a star wars (now "legends" since disney bought the company) author named Karen Traviss (she got kinda crazy and right wing but i find the community at large 
to persist without political spin). KT really fleshed it out through the five-part book series <em>republic commando</em> after the video game series by the same name (2005). it was kicked off when a composer for the 
game named Jesse Harlin needed to invent a spoken form for a piece of music. the two mando'a songs from this game that became community staples were called "vode an" ("brothers all") and "dha werda verda" ("dark shadow 
warriors" or something close to that).</p>
<p>(i have collected and read all five republic commando novels. i still have both vode an and dha werda verda memorized. i was in <u>neck deep</u> my brothers)</p>
<p>the language itself is somehow simultanously fabulously complex and understatedly suggesting of minimal effort in construction. verb conjugation is excedingly simple and the prefix markers for each of the merely three 
tenses are dropped as frequently (more?) than they are used, but this is attributed to the prioritization required by warlike culture of the mandalorians and a cultural difference in the perception of time. vocabulary 
is somewhat limited, leaving the users to create massive compounds to express certain ideas, but the language is recognized as agglutinative and even includes a punctuation mark intended by the creator to connect such 
pieces (the ' "beten", lit. "sigh", pronounced as a glottal stop). the simplicities keep rolling in, but all reflect a difference moreso than a fault and carry their own cultural significance. (earlier when i was trying 
to figure out whether dha werda verda or vode an came first (unsuccessfully) i discovered that since i last checked, someone actually listed mando'a as agglutinative under the language section on the wikipedia page for 
mandalorians. my heart)</p>
<p> i really probably could go on forever about this, but i'll close out with a lighting round of a few more features i think are neat.</p>
<ul>
	<li>mando'a doesn't have grammatical gender! the culture tidbit this is intended to carry is that gender isn't recongized as significant to warriorship, especially relevant for a group of people that's masked 
	most of the time (whether influenced by history or her own ideology, KT did throw in a few odd gender role notes to the culture throughout the novels, but especially with more recent mandalorian-centric media
	 i think the community at large has ceased to recognize at least most of that side of the content.) some also trace the idea back even further to the taung, the humanoid(ish) specied that started the mandalorian 
	way of living, suggesting that they didn't have a gender system comparable to the human one that our gramatically-gendered languages try to fit around.</li>
	<li>one of many examples of mando'a defying english translation conventions: two words can be used to translate "understand" and neither quite fits. "haa'taylir", to see, can fill the need of something 
	lighter-- more akin to "i get it", literally translating as "to hold in one's eyes". "kar'taylir", "to hold in one's heart", references a total and complete understanding (think "grok" from stranger in a strange 
	land). based on defined cultural values, the latter is actually the word used to express love ("i love you" being "ni kar'tayli gar darasuum", word-for-word "i completely-understand you forever"). </li>
	<li> you know that sorta spicy feeling in your nose that happens when you eat horseradish or wasabi? mando'a has a word for that. the language differentiates between het'uram ("hot-mouth") and heti'kles ("hot-nose").</li>
</ul>

	<p>EDIT: hyperbolic adjective warning! i am chill</p>
<p>i thought it was the trees. but no. it is not simply my own immune system attacking me... but some other kind of illness.</p>
<p>despite the fact that i accepted it as scientific fact long, long ago, the idea that there are little dudes running around in your 
	bloodstream-- external agents, speficically-- serving as the cause of illness still tends to feel so strange. like, what do you 
	<em>mean </em>a bunch of strange microorganisms are at war with me? Not even me-- my own small army of microscopic units, no 
	less? ...there's something existential about being sick that gets you thinking about exactly what you're made out of.</p>
<p>in the past, of course, this idea was beyond fathom. how could these little beasts be fighting me if i can't see them (and, well, 
	can see me)? it seemed more likely somehow that some cause among the number of spirit posession, vengeful spell, humour imbalance, 
	or even personality fault would trigger an illness. lots of problematic ideas come out of this sort of thinking, probably formost 
	among them being that illness is representative of some sort of personal fault ("you were too crabby so now you have tuberculosis" 
	sort of reasoning). Additional ramifications included the blame being placed elsewhere, generally on minorities ("the women can 
	read?? dark magick. that must be why billy bob joe has been sneezing lately"), though, I find, in large part this culpability 
	tended to fall on the sufferer themself.</p>
<p>this idea, i think, is seperate but related to how mental turmoil can (nonfictitiously) register as physical illness. Especially at 
	times of major transition-- though, not too rarely, sporadically as well-- stress, rage, and gloom can take a major toll on the
	 body. the mind is inseperable from the brain, after all, and the brain is an organ-- this makes sense.</p>
<p>that doesn't make it fun, though. i'm starting to suspect that the allied powers of pollen and Invisible Bros have a third comrade: 
	the emotional boatload this time of year was bound to hit me with all along, between the end of build season (and all the 
	associated returning-to-"normal-life" business), AP exams and finals, and all the good friends of mine-- members of a close-knit 
	community that i not only prize but feel has helped me in so many ways-- graduating past the rocky stage of life where i remain 
	and moving on to another. --someone has already even referenced my state of ailment as 'dysthymic'.</p>
<p>all i can do, as with anyone in this kind of a situation, is keep trying to get better. what "get better" means can be ambiguous. even 
	as a staunch adherent of the scientific disciplines, i can begin to see the appeal of those age-old explanations: a blocked chakra 
	is a lot easier to blame than microscopic adversaries or the harsh realities of life transitions; a malicious spell is easier 
	to target seeing as the nebulous definitions come from your end rather than the problem's. again, this observation is more 
	indulgent than faithful... but a stratified issue takes stratified approaches, and i'm not one to close my mind to considerations.</p>
<p> as i sit here, languishing in my inability to concentrate on homework, I find myself drawing upon an idea transmitted to me via the 
	martial arts. the concept ki (chi, in its more familiar Chinese transliteration) describes the energy that flows through the body. 
	i'd call it equally spiritual and psychological were its goal not to unite the two concepts; the first thing that a ki-heavy art 
	will teach you is that it is by no means a mystical, unattainable thing, rather a manifestation of your will-- mental drive?-- 
	whose representation sums a far more complex series of thoughts and phsyical sensations into something raw and operable (in relating 
	the concept the first comparison that comes to mind is work and energy in physics-- energy isn't a "real thing", but it's a 
	quantity that sums up a lot of other phenomema and simplifies calculations by leagues). again, complex problems require complex 
	responses... and with a human mind-- tending to reject the complex-- a nice package such as this could be just the thing to 
	tackle it. for all my atheistic tendencies, i've begun to view whatever ailment i currently face as a blockage of ki (conventionally 
	believed to cause illness) and am treating it as such. honestly? i think it's working. </p>
<p> maybe it's just that i have a codified way to take care of myself; maybe it's just structure in an undefined maelstrom. this calls 
	to mind the premise of absurdism. even adherents of a school of thought where the fact that life is considered meaningless is 
	simply to be accepted (as opposed to its cousin existentialism, where one is instructed to generate one's own meaning in the 
	face of the same question) understand that the human mind can't seem to take such a bold statement, thus recognizing that certain 
	"constructions" (i.e. of purpose) must be adpoted in day-to-day life simply to stay sane. maybe, here, ki is a construction saving 
	me from attempting to process a load of unprocessable miscelanea while continuing on a path to recovery.</p>
<p> i'm gonna keep taking it easy on myself today. if the homework needs to happen over the weekend, it happens over the weekend.</p>

	<p> some of you may be aware of the interesting developments coming (<em>*ghost voice* pdpqqqqqq....</em>). be not alarmed; they shall be along... some day or another here. in the meantime, though,
	i'm going on a whole adventure that has taken me from the exton mall to w3schools to a plane thousands of miles above texas. the plane part was probably the most interesting segment... suddenly overcome
	 by the base urge to conquer javascript, five minutes before the plane was set to board, i whipped out my laptop and started googling frantically. that information and the few screenshots i managed to grab 
	served me decently well... that is, to a point. several hours in to the flight itself, i wound up staring at my device, out of experience, trying desperately to guess at any potential parallels between the
	 syntax of java and javascript. (i found out a bit too late after that that the equivalent to a hashmap is just called a "map" in js... would have liked to know that a lot sooner...) the progress was slow-- 
	but steady-- but slow.</p>
	<p>flash forward to me not having touched it in weeks.</p>
	<p>c'est la vie, i suppose. being catapulted straight from build season to exam season was bound to present a damper. the long-anticipated mysterious work (<em>*ghost voice* pdpqqqqqq....!</em>) will 
	turn out sooner than later. it's just a matter of when i catch a second between finals to iron out the transitions...</p>
