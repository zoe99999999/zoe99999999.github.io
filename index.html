<div style="float: left;"> <span style="font-size: 30px;"><b>illness</b></span> | "there's no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole" </div><div style="float: right;">5/2/25 (already??) 12:40</div> </br></br>
<p>i thought it was the trees. but no. it is not simply my own immune system attacking me... but some other kind of illness.</p>
<p>despite the fact that i accepted it as scientific fact long, long ago, the idea that there are little dudes running around in your 
	bloodstream-- external agents, speficically-- serving as the cause of illness still tends to feel so strange. like, what do you 
	<em>mean </em>a bunch of strange microorganisms are at war with me? Not even me-- my own small army of microscopic units, no 
	less? ...there's something existential about being sick that gets you thinking about exactly what you're made out of.</p>
<p>in the past, of course, this idea was beyond fathom. how could these little beasts be fighting me if i can't see them (and, well, 
	can see me)? it seemed more likely somehow that some cause among the number of spirit posession, vengeful spell, humour imbalance, 
	or even personality fault would trigger an illness. lots of problematic ideas come out of this sort of thinking, probably formost 
	among them being that illness is representative of some sort of personal fault ("you were too crabby so now you have tuberculosis" 
	sort of reasoning). Additional ramifications included the blame being placed elsewhere, generally on minorities ("the women can 
	read?? dark magick. that must be why billy bob joe has been sneezing lately"), though, I find, in large part this culpability 
	tended to fall on the sufferer themself.</p>
<p>this idea, i think, is seperate but related to how mental turmoil can (nonfictitiously) register as physical illness. Especially at 
	times of major transition-- though, not too rarely, sporadically as well-- stress, rage, and gloom can take a major toll on the
	 body. the mind is inseperable from the brain, after all, and the brain is an organ-- this makes sense.</p>
<p>that doesn't make it fun, though. i'm starting to suspect that the allied powers of pollen and Invisible Bros have a third comrade: 
	the emotional boatload this time of year was bound to hit me with all along, between the end of build season (and all the 
	associated returning-to-"normal-life" business), AP exams and finals, and all the good friends of mine-- members of a close-knit 
	community that i not only prize but feel has helped me in so many ways-- graduating past the rocky stage of life where i remain 
	and moving on to another. --someone has already even referenced my state of ailment as 'dysthymic'.</p>
<p>all i can do, as with anyone in this kind of a situation, is keep trying to get better. what "get better" means can be ambiguous. even 
	as a staunch adherent of the scientific disciplines, i can begin to see the appeal of those age-old explanations: a blocked chakra 
	is a lot easier to blame than microscopic adversaries or the harsh realities of life transitions; a malicious spell is easier 
	to target seeing as the nebulous definitions come from your end rather than the problem's. again, this observation is more 
	indulgent than faithful... but a stratified issue takes stratified approaches, and i'm not one to close my mind to considerations.</p>
<p> as i sit here, languishing in my inability to concentrate on homework, I find myself drawing upon an idea transmitted to me via the 
	martial arts. the concept ki (chi, in its more familiar Chinese transliteration) describes the energy that flows through the body. 
	i'd call it equally spiritual and psychological were its goal not to unite the two concepts; the first thing that a ki-heavy art 
	will teach you is that it is by no means a mystical, unattainable thing, rather a manifestation of your will-- mental drive?-- 
	whose representation sums a far more complex series of thoughts and phsyical sensations into something raw and operable (in relating 
	the concept the first comparison that comes to mind is work and energy in physics-- energy isn't a "real thing", but it's a 
	quantity that sums up a lot of other phenomema and simplifies calculations by leagues). again, complex problems require complex 
	responses... and with a human mind-- tending to reject the complex-- a nice package such as this could be just the thing to 
	tackle it. for all my atheistic tendencies, i've begun to view whatever ailment i currently face as a blockage of ki (conventionally 
	believed to cause illness) and am treating it as such. honestly? i think it's working. </p>
<p> maybe it's just that i have a codified way to take care of myself; maybe it's just structure in an undefined maelstrom. this calls 
	to mind the premise of absurdism. even adherents of a school of thought where the fact that life is considered meaningless is 
	simply to be accepted (as opposed to its cousin existentialism, where one is instructed to generate one's own meaning in the 
	face of the same question) understand that the human mind can't seem to take such a bold statement, thus recognizing that certain 
	"constructions" (i.e. of purpose) must be adpoted in day-to-day life simply to stay sane. maybe, here, ki is a construction saving 
	me from attempting to process a load of unprocessable miscelanea while continuing on a path to recovery.</p>
<p> i'm gonna keep taking it easy on myself today. if the homework needs to happen over the weekend, it happens over the weekend.</p>

	<p> some of you may be aware of the interesting developments coming (<em>*ghost voice* pdpqqqqqq....</em>). be not alarmed; they shall be along... some day or another here. in the meantime, though,
	i'm going on a whole adventure that has taken me from the exton mall to w3schools to a plane thousands of miles above texas. the plane part was probably the most interesting segment... suddenly overcome
	 by the base urge to conquer javascript, five minutes before the plane was set to board, i whipped out my laptop and started googling frantically. that information and the few screenshots i managed to grab 
	served me decently well... that is, to a point. several hours in to the flight itself, i wound up staring at my device, out of experience, trying desperately to guess at any potential parallels between the
	 syntax of java and javascript. (i found out a bit too late after that that the equivalent to a hashmap is just called a "map" in js... would have liked to know that a lot sooner...) the progress was slow-- 
	but steady-- but slow.</p>
	<p>flash forward to me not having touched it in weeks.</p>
	<p>c'est la vie, i suppose. being catapulted straight from build season to exam season was bound to present a damper. the long-anticipated mysterious work (<em>*ghost voice* pdpqqqqqq....!</em>) will 
	turn out sooner than later. it's just a matter of when i catch a second between finals to iron out the transitions...</p>
